        <p>Tinola is a Filipino soup usually served as a main course with white rice. Traditionally, this dish is cooked with chicken or fish, wedges of papaya and/or chayote, and leaves of the siling labuyo chili pepper in broth flavored with ginger, onions and fish sauce.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 lbs. chicken, cut into serving pieces</li>
            <li>2 green papaya, wedged</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cup malunggay leaves</li>
            <li>1 cup hot pepper leaves</li>
            <li>5 gloves garlic, crushed and chopped</li>
            <li>1 onions, chopped</li>
            <li>3 thumbs ginger, julienned</li>
            <li>2 Maggi Magic Chicken Cubes</li>
            <li>1 quart rice wash</li>
            <li>1 quart water, as needed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
            <li>Ground black pepper to taste (optional)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Get a pot and bring it up to medium heat before pouring in the oil. Drop in the onions, garlic and ginger and sauté slowly for about 2 minutes or until you can smell the lovely aroma.</li><br>
            <li>It’s time to drop in the chicken pieces and stir until it turns white or light brown in color.</li><br>
            <li>Pour in the water and add your Knorr Chicken Broth cubes. Bring this to a simmer until chicken is tender and cooked through.</li><br>
            <li>You can now add your sayote or green papaya and cook until tender.</li><br>
            <li>Dahon ng sili is added at the last stage to ensure leaves (and nutrients) don’t dry up. Give this a minute then it is done. Malunggay is also another healthy alternative because it is packed with vitamins and minerals which are good for nursing moms and kids as well.</li><br>
            <li>Enjoy this with patis and calamansi on the side. See the faces of your whole family light up as you bring this to the table.</li><br>
